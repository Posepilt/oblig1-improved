                <h2>BEM</h2>
                <p>I used the BEM method to name HTML classes clearly and predictably. Main components (e.g., header, sections, footer) serve as blocks, while child elements are named using the blockâ€™s name, followed by __ and a descriptive word (e.g., header__logo, hero__button). This prevents name conflicts and simplifies class naming.</p>
                <p>I only used a modifier for buttons since the page is small, but in larger projects with multiple buttons, cards, or themes, modifiers would be useful.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Stack and Cover layout</h2>
                <p>I used two stack layouts, one with larger margins for section separation and a smaller one for spacing within sections. This keeps the design structured and consistent.</p>
                <p>The hero section uses a cover layout, with styles placed in the hero-section file for organization.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>SASS files</h2>
                <p>I structured my SASS files into category folders and combined them into one main file using @use and @forward in _index files. This reduces clutter and allows linking just one stylesheet in HTML. I tried compiling separate SASS files into individual CSS files but found it inefficient.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Main design decisions</h2>
                <p><b>Visual Hierarchy:</b> I used typography, heading levels (h1, h2, h3), and spacing to create a clear structure.</p>
                <p><b>Consistency:</b> SASS variables ensure uniform colors, and reusing stack layouts, grids and utility classes maintains a consistent design.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Logical properties</h2>
                <p>I applied logical properties for margins, padding, text alignment, width, and height to improve accessibility for different reading directions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Responsive without media queries</h2>
                <p>I went for mobile first approach. From there I used responsive units (rem, %, viewport units) and the min() function to scale the layout naturally across devices. This limits full-width use on large screens, but it works without media queries.</p>
